# Excel_VBA
---------------------
 Welcome to my Public EXCEL VBA respository!
---------------------
 
I am a geotechnical engineer in the transportation infrastructure field, and I have been developing Excel VBA programs for practical automation at work since 2010. In Summer of 
2020, I went through the excellent INLY Summer Program taught by Alec Walker (www.inly.dev), which added data science tools to my toolbox. I also learned a great deal about 
Python and caught the vision for how Excel VBA and Python can augment one another. Alec also helped demystify the process of posting a project on GitHub - and the very first 
project posted in this repository is my final project for the summer class.

NOTE: ALL of the files posted in this repository were created on my OWN time using my OWN resources, and I am making them freely available to the public under the MIT license.
